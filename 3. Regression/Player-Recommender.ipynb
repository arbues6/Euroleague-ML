    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "As always, the first step is to load all required data: in particular, we'll use the matrix of individual 1x10 feature vectors and the pre-trained models (pkl files, one model per stat and per combination). Note as well that, if we want to check who is the ideal player when fitting in a lineup of N players, we have to load the model trained for N+1 players. "
