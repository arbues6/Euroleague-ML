# Euroleague-ML
The aim of this repository is to publish several Python Notebooks to see how Machine Learning (ML) can be applied to basketball-based European Datasets. Although the given examples are quite simple, I expect these models to provide coaches/analysts/GM's with concrete baseline examples. 
In particular, at the moment (January 12th 2020), three tutorials about ML gold-standards have been included:
1. Clustering, where K-Means is used to group similar types of shooters based on shotchart-based features. 
2. Classification, where SVM is used to build a model able to classify player positions. 
3. Regression, where linear models are used in order to predict several statistics, as well as suggesting potentially interesting players for a given lineup. 

I really hope you find it useful. If you have any questions / suggestions, feel free to send me an email (adria.arbues@upf.edu) or a Twitter DM (@arbues6).
Big shoutout also to Nacho GÃ¡mez (@ngamezj), who provided me with a notable dataset to get started.
